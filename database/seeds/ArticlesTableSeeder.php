                        You might have expected that much of the legal profession adhere to a business/professional dress code. This can be the case, especially in top tier practices, but as David Forsdyke, Managing Director at Michael Page Legal explains, many legal teams and law firms are trying to demonstrate a more flexible approach to the working environment. This is often reflected in a dress code, which is smart casual rather than a formal/professional approach. In the case of in-house legal teams in creative industry sectors, such as digital or media, the legal team usually adopt a more casual approach, appropriate for that business environment. David notes that while people should judge you on your skills, experience and competencies, human nature is such that judgements are made, rightly or wrongly, on attire and personal presentation. While smart means different things to different people, he suggests that regardless of dress code if you make a real effort, it will be appreciated.\n
